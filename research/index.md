## <i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"> Understanding barrier tissue immunity
{% capture text %}
Mapping the biological tissues that make up the human body at a single cell level has revealed unique cell types and putative cell-cell interactions that were previously unknown. The oral mucosa is a complex tissue that contains keratinized and non-keratinized epithelium, immune cells, and stromal cells. I apply next generation sequencing technologies to identify cell populations with inflammatory signatures that promote antimicrobial defense and neutrophil recruitment and assess gene and cell-type alterations that occur in periodontal disease, one of the most common inflammatory diseases in adults.

## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"> Tracking host-microbe interactions
{% capture text %}
The oral cavity houses one of the most diverse microbial niches in the human body containing over 700 bacterial species. However, low abundance oral-associated microbes like *Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans* have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of aggressive periodontal disease in adolescents. Disease leads to massive increases in tissue and lymph-associated T cells, which begs the question: do microbiota-specific T cells mediate pathogenic responses to pathobionts? I am currently developing tools to track and assess microbe-specific T cell responses in animal models of periodontitis.

## <i class="fas fa-syringe"> Immunity and fungal infection
{% capture text %}
Type 17 responses have been shown to play a pivotal role in several models of mucosal infection. However, a collaborator found that chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) caused by loss-of-function mutations in the autoimmune regulator (*Aire*) gene did not lead to altered type 17 responses in the skin or gut of *Aire^-/-* mice. I helped confirm that type 17 responses were intact in the oral mucosa of *Aire^-/-* mice. Instead, we found that CMC was caused by T cell-dependent interferonopathy in the mucosa of *Aire^-/-* mice, which was corroborated in a patient cohort with *Aire* loss-of-function. Using single cell sequencing, I am assessing how patients with a gain-of-function mutation in *Stat1*, which causes CMC, alters cell composition and gene expression at the oral barrier.
