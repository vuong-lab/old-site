## <i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Understanding barrier tissue immunity
{% capture text %}
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, I have: 
- created a transcriptional atlas of two distinct oral mucosal sites in health and in the common inflammatory disease periodontitis
- discovered inflammatory signatures that define stromal populations in health
- identified novel stromal-immune interactions that potentially drive oral mucosal inflammation in disease

## <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i> Molecular architecture and deep immunophenotyping of the oral barrier
{% capture text %}
To understand how mucosal structure relates to function and immune response, I am: 
- utilizing multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), spatial transcriptomics (Visium), and *in situ* hybridization (RNAScope) to localize distinct populations of stromal, epithelial and immune cells in health and periodontal disease
- enriching our single-cell atlas by combining Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) and spectral cytometry to enable deeper understanding of cell populations present at the oral mucosa.

## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i> Probing host-microbe interactions in the oral mucosa
{% capture text %}
To determine how the innate and adaptive immune system responds to bacterial and fungal stimuli, I am: 
- using flow-cytometry-based bacterial/fungal cell sorting and 16S/ITS sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the oral microbiota with immunoglobulin 
- developing tools to assess T-cell specific responses to known oral pathogens.

## <i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Mucosal immunity through the lens of mendelian defects
{% capture text %}
The Moutsopoulos Lab sees several cohorts of patients that have single gene mutations which lead to severe oral disease. Using single cell sequencing, I am assessing how experimental treatment influences cell composition and gene expression in:
- patients with a gain-of-function mutation in *Stat1*, which causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and severe oral ulcers
- patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1, which causes severe gingival immunopathology leading to early-life tooth loss
